This directory contains the Nature's Source
logo image, only so that when an HTML e-mail
is sent in Chapter 8 we can use a shorter,
somewhat less specific absolute URL path to
this instance of the logo, since a relative
path to some other instance of the logo on
this site would clearly not work to provide
access to the logo in a user's e-mail.
