ch02/readme.txt

The only sample file in this directory is first.txt.
It gets us started with our Nature's Source website,
but another purpose which it serves is to demonstrate
that when viewed in a browser a file of text retains
its formatting. However it is important to understand
that this only happens if the browser "knows" or at
least "thinks" that the file does indeed contain text.
In this case the browser makes that assumption because
the file has a .txt extension. Browsers typically use
the file extension to deduce the "MIME type" (kind of
content) of a file, and then deal with it accordingly.
