ch03/nature1_readme.txt

The nature1 subdirectory contains the first version
of our Nature's Source website. Only because we do
not yet have any CSS at our disposal we are using
a four-cell table for the page layout of index.html.
The top-left cell contains the logo, the top-right
cell contains the company address, the bottom-left
cell contains the text we want clients to read when
they come to our website home page, and the bottom-
right cell contains a business-related image.

Despite its deficiencies in terms of layout methodology,
this page will nevertheless validate as HTML 5.
