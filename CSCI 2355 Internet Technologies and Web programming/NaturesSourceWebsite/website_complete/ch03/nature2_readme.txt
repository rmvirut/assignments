ch03/nature2_readme.txt

The nature2 subdirectory contains the second version
of our Nature's Source website. Once again, and again
only because we do not yet have any CSS at our disposal,
we are using a table for page layout all of our pages.

This time the table used for our home page has four rows,
with a varying number of cells in each row, depending on
the content requirements for the row in question.

The first row now contains just the logo. Note that the
company information has "disappeared" from the home page,
and now appears under the "Contact Us | Our Locations" link.

The second row contains the main menu of links to other pages.

The third row contains the text we want our visitors to read
when they first arrive at the home page of our website, plus
our business-related image. On some of our secondary pages
this third row contains a secondary menu of additional links,
with the main text for that particular page at the right. None
of the secondary pages contains the image seen on our home page
(or any other image, for that matter).

The fourth and final row is the "footer row", which contains
copyright information and another, shorter menu with two
additional menu links.

Every page on this version of the website should validate
as HTML 5.
