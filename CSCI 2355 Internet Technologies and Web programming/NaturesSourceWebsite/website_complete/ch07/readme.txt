Study Order for Files in This Directory
These are the files from Chapter 7.
---------------------------------------

This directory contains two versions of our
Nature's source website (nature1 and nature2).
The overall goal of this chapter is to introduce
the necessary HTML, CSS and JavaScript to deal
with the rotating business-related images on our 
home page, as well as the dropdown menus that
appear on all pages. The nature1 version has
the rotating images and dropdown menus, but
none of the links to other pages is active.
In the nature2 version all links are active,
and the two forms introduced previously (BMI
and feedback) have also been incorporated.

All web pages in this directory should validate
as HTML 5 and CSS 3.

1. The nature1 subdirectory (see nature1_readme.txt)
2. The nature2 subdirectory (see nature2_readme.txt)

================ RESPONSIVE DESIGN ================
Both nature1 and nature2 website versions in this
chapter continue to exhibit the responsive design
as described in ch04/nature3_readme.txt.
