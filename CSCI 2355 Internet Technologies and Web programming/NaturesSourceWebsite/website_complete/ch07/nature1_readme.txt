ch07/nature1_readme.txt

The nature1 subdirectory of this chapter contains
a version of our Nature's Source website that has
implemented rotating images on the home page, as
well as "dropdown" menus that are activated when
the user's mouse hovers over (most of) the items
in the main menu (except for Home, e-store, and
Site Map). Note, however, that this site contains
only the home page, since none of the dropdown
menu links on the page is active.

The only page (the home page) in this version of 
our website should validate as HTML 5 and CSS 3.
