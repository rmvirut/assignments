1. welcome.php
   Shows a static welcome page with a date and time that
   do not update.

2. welcome_refresh.php
   Shows a dynamic welcome page with a date and time that
   update every 60 seconds, but the entire page refreshes
   at that rate.

3. welcome_ajax.php
   Shows a dynamic welcome page on which the date and time
   information lines update every 60 seconds but the rest
   of the page remains static after loading.

4. time.php
   Provides the updated date and time to the AJAX request
   from welcome_ajax.php.
   
5. test_get.html and test_get.php
   These two files illustrate how the GET protocol works
   for submitting form data to a server-side PHP script
   for processing.

6. test_post.html and test_post.php
   These two files illustrate how the POST protocol works
   for submitting form data to a server-side PHP script
   for processing.

7. get_is_the_default.php
   This file illustrates the fact that you can supply data
   to a PHP script directly (at the end of its URL), without
   using a form to submit the data, and when you do so it is
   the GET protocol that applies.
