ch04/nature2_readme.txt

The nature2 subdirectory of this chapter contains
a version of our Nature's Source website that is
functionally equivalent to either nature2 or nature3
from Chapter 3 (remember that the only difference
between those two was "behind the scenes", in that
nature3 used SSI, whereas nature2 did not). Though
the functionality of the current nature2 is the 
same as those previous two versions, the styling
and layout are very different since this one uses
CSS for both styling and layout of the home page
as well as for all the pages that link to it. We
hope you agree that the website is much improved
by this use of CSS.

This version of our website also makes use of the
following HTML 5 new semantic elements:
header, footer, main, article and nav

Every page on this version of the website should
validate as HTML 5 and CSS 3.
