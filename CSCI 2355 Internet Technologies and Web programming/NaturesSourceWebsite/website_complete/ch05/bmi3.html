      <p>Total body fat is correlated to the risk of certain diseases
      which can be potentially fatal. BMI is valid for both men and women.
      However, it should only be used as a guideline as it has some
      limitations. It may overestimate the body fat in muscular persons and
      underestimate the body fat in persons who have lost muscle mass.</p>
