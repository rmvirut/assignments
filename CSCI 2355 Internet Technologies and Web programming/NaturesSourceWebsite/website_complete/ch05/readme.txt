Study Order for Files in This Directory
These are the files from Chapter 5.
---------------------------------------

0. default.css
The CSS file used for all files in this directory.

1. bmi1.html
To illustrate that an empty form element has
no effect on page display.

2. bmi2.html
To illustrate input elements of type "text",
"radio" and "checkbox".

3. bmi3.html
To illustrate the "select" and "option" elements
as an alternate to the elements of type "radio"
of the previous example.

4. feedback1.html
To illustrate the use of an empty "option" element
within a select element, as well as the "textarea"
element.

5. feedback2.html
To illustrate an input element of type "submit" and
an input element of type "reset", though these are
inactive for the moment.

6. bmi4.html
To illustrate input elements of type "submit" and "reset"
on our BMI form, and also the "fieldset" and "legend"
elements that allow us to group logically connected
elements on our form.

7. bmi5.html
This example looks exactly like the display of bmi4.html
in the browser, but also incorporates the "label" element
with its "for" attribute (whose value matches the "id"
attribute of a corresponding "input" element) to enhance
form usability.

All files in this directory should validate
as HTML 5 and CSS 3.
