<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Could not fully implement javascript validation for the feedback form or the service request form.
No feature to report the sum of total products purchased.
=======
*Rotating images on homepage implemented successfully with no know issues.
*Also implemented dropdown submenu feature for the navbar successfully
*Currently no links for "Make and Appointment" and "Got questions" as there
wasn't enough time to populate the page
*Issue with form validation will be resolved eventually
>>>>>>> Stashed changes
