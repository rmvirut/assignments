Our Reason
==========

    Since the turn of the 21st Century, technology has rapidly become vital to our individual lives. More importantly, it's become critical to anyone looking to 
succeed in business. All aspects of day-to-day business including payments, 
accounting, content management, inventory, HR management, marketing, email and 
networking, communication (etc.) systems have become entirely software-based.

    However, as ubiquitous as technology has become in the digital age, busy 
professionals don’t necessarily have the time to learn new skills to take full 
advantage, let alone leverage, the potential of free open source technology 
available to them.


Our Story
=========

    During September 2016 while taking a course in business management at the Saint 
Mary’s University, a project was assigned to setup a simple two-day business 
venture with no more than $1 investment. Up until then, I had always had the 
idea of starting a company that would provide open-source software alternatives
to small businesses.

    Equipped with two years in computing science and love for technology, I had 
become well informed about a lot of software and their inner workings. However,
I was reluctant to start because I didn’t have the time to investigate the 
industry thoroughly but this was my opportunity to not only get my idea of 
running an open-source dependent IT company off the ground, but I could make it 
part of school and get some advice from my professor who was an experienced 
entrepreneur.

    I did my research, drew up a business plan and got my 2-day venture running on September 26, 2016 but started it off as a PC repair company.

    The idea that led to Diji Domain was put to the test; Starting and operating a
small business with no capital for IT. Long story short, I didn’t even need the $1
investment in the end, got an A+ on the course and, if you’re reading this, kept
the business running beyond the two days it was required to operate. I’ve managed
to start an entire company using 0$. Since then we’ve (now a team of four) worked
with clients from all walks of life and several industries.

    More hands also mean we’ve increased our talent pool, especially, in website 
and mobile applications development.

    By God’s grace we’ve come a long way from a humble one-man pc repair gig. But
we won’t forget that offering technical support to small businesses and 
individuals is still at the core of our business and we hope to serve small and
medium businesses within [and without] the Maritimes for a long time to come.
    
    Thanks for your time and we hope to get the chance to work with you.
