    <!--ABOUT US SECTION-->
    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Our Reason</h3>
    <p>Since the turn of the 21st Century, technology has rapidly become vital to our
      individual lives. More importantly, it's become critical to anyone looking
      to succeed in business. All aspects of day-to-day business including payments,
      accounting, content management, inventory, HR management, marketing, email
      and networking, communication (etc.) systems have become entirely software-based.</p>
    <p>
      However, as ubiquitous as technology has become in the digital age, busy professionals
      don’t necessarily have the time to learn new skills to take full advantage,
      let alone leverage, the potential of free open source technology available
      to them.</p>

    <h3>Our Story</h3>
    <p>During September 2016 while taking a course in business management at the Saint
      Mary’s University, a project was assigned to setup a simple two-day business
      venture with no more than $1 investment. Up until then, I had always had the
      idea of starting a company that would provide open-source software alternatives
      to small businesses.</p>
    <p>

      Equipped with two years in computing science and love for technology, I had become
      well informed about a lot of software and their inner workings. However, I
      was reluctant to start because I didn’t have the time to investigate the industry
      thoroughly but this was my opportunity to not only get my idea of running an
      open-source dependent IT company off the ground, but I could make it part of
      school and get some advice from my professor who was an experienced entrepreneur.
    </p>
    <p>

      I did my research, drew up a business plan and got my 2-day venture running on September
      26, 2016 but started it off as a PC repair company. The idea that led to Diji
      Domain was put to the test; Starting and operating a small business with no
      capital for IT. Long story short, I didn’t even need the $1 investment in the
      end, got an A+ on the course and, if you’re reading this, kept the business
      running beyond the two days it was required to operate. I’ve managed to start
      an entire company using 0$. Since then we’ve (now a team of four) worked with
      clients from all walks of life and several industries.</p>
    <p>

      More hands also mean we’ve increased our talent pool, especially, in website and
      mobile applications development.</p>
    <p>

      By God’s grace we’ve come a long way from a humble one-man pc repair gig. But we
      won’t forget that offering technical support to small businesses and individuals
      is still at the core of our business and we hope to serve small and medium
      businesses within [and without] the Maritimes for a long time to come.</p>
    <p>

      Thanks for your time and we hope to get the chance to work with you.<br> -
