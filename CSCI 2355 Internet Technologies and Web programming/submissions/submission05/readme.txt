Summary
=======
Updated site from previous assigment using css to design layout. The website works fine and has been validated using Validator, a chrome extension.
Both css file have been validated using the validation tool provided by Dr Scobey. The desktop.css yields 1 error saying the property-value pair "position:sticky"
are not valid although they are documented in MDN and W3schools as being valid attributes and values. There was no alternative so I had to settle for it.
