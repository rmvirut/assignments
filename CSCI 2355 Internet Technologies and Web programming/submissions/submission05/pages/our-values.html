    <h4>MISSION</h4>
    <p>
        Provide affordable IT services to small businesses. We love technology and companies like affordable IT services if they can get it. We seek to meet that need . But more importanly, we wanna start with you as a seed till you've become a tree i.e. have
        a long term relationship with you andtake care of your technical needs.
    </p>
    <h4>Our Values</h4>
    <p>We have four cardinal principles we work by and they are:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt><b>Transparency</b></dt>
        <dd>
            We won't promise not to throw around technical jargons, but when and if we do, we'll be sure to bring you up to speed. Also, considering we're mostly students with limited experience, it's to your benefit and ours that we're upfront with you when we don't
            know and we'll do just that when it comes to it.
        </dd>
        <dt><b>Efficiency</b></dt>
        <dd>
            Time is of the essence for every business[wo]man and so we'll be prompt to meet set dealines and milestones for every project we embark on to make sure you're satisfied. However, we will not sacrifice efficiency of your solution simply to "get it done".
        </dd>
        <dt><b>Quality</b></dt>
        <dd>
            Opensource software is notorious for having bugs and also being a tad more difficult to omplement than their proprietary counterpart. They also have a habit of having terrible <abbr title="User Interfaces">UIs</abbr>. We won't let that stop
            us from giving you the best they have to offer
        </dd>
        <dt><b>Reliability</b></dt>
        <dd>
            Being available when you need us to be and supporting you whenever you need it. Offering robust and solutions and not using the fact that "it's opensource" an excuse to deliver sub-par service(s). We want to earn your trust <i>and</i> your
            respect as an individual and as a business.
