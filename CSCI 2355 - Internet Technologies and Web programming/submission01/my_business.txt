About Us
    Since the turn of the 21st Century, technology has rapidly become vital to our individual lives. More importantly,
it's become critical to anyone looking to succeed in the business world as it transcends all aspects of day-to-day
business including; payments, accounting, content management, inventory, HR management, marketing, email and 
networking, communication (etc.) systems. "Basically, you cannot run a successful business without technology." 
    Unfortunately, as ubiquitous as technology has become in the digital age, busy professionals don’t necessarily 
have the time to learn new skills to effectively implement the best IT solutions let alone leverage the vast 
potential of free open source technology available to them even though it's a must-have; And many can't afford 
an in-house IT department either. We located the problem and now we have the solution.
    Established in September, 2016, Diji Domain is a small, Halifax-based tech company whose goal is giving small and 
medium businesses access to reliable IT infrastructure and support while keeping the budget constraints of the 
sectors demographic in mind. Once a simple student project, we have evolved from a humble laptop repair service 
into a respectable provider of business information and technology solutions.
